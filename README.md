# iBench-Plus

iBench-Plus is an improved version of iBench, which is a suite of contentious microbenchmarks targeting at shared resources on multi-core chips.
Compared to iBench, iBench-Plus has more functionalities, and is more configurable. Some benchmarks can now be guaranteed to run on multicores.

The original repository can be found at https://github.com/stanford-mast/iBench.

iBench is a suite of contentious microbenchmarks. Each microbenchmark targets a different shared resource in a multi-core chip (processing cores, cache capacity, main memory capacity & bandwidth) and has tunable intensity.
